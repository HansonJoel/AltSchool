            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><Strong>Hello!</Strong><br>
                My name is Joel Hanson.
                I’m a GIS Enthusiast and Aspiring Web Developer. 
                <br>
                I have a background in Geoinformatics and Surveying,
                I’m passionate about exploring the world through spatial data. As a GIS enthusiast, I dive into location-based insights, crafting meaningful visual stories with tools like ArcGIS, QGIS and StoryMaps.
                <br>
                But I’m not stopping there — I’m expanding into web development to bring GIS to the web. From mastering HTML and CSS to diving into JavaScript, I’m building the skills to create dynamic, data-driven maps and applications accessible to everyone, everywhere.
                <br>
                Every project is a journey — whether I’m designing intuitive web pages, analyzing complex datasets, or simplifying spatial insights, I strive to make data speak clearly and beautifully.
                <br>
                Let’s build the future of mapping together!

            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal for this program is to deepen my understanding of software       development, build a solid foundation in coding, and apply these skills to create, maintain, and deliver innovative GIS solutions.  
                <br>
                By the end of this program, I aim to confidently:  
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Craft GIS APIs</strong> to support seamless access to spatial data, enabling dynamic mapping and real-time analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implement Geospatial Business Logic</strong> to handle complex spatial workflows and ensure accurate processing of location-based data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design and Manage Spatial Databases</strong> to efficiently store, query, and retrieve large geospatial datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Data Security</strong> by applying best practices to protect sensitive geospatial information and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimize Performance</strong> to handle massive spatial datasets and improve system responsiveness in GIS applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrate Geospatial Services</strong> to connect diverse tools, platforms, and APIs, enabling smooth interoperability between GIS systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan for Scalability</strong> to ensure GIS applications grow efficiently alongside increasing data volumes and user demands.</li>
                </ul>
