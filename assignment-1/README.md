# 🏫 AltSchool Assignment - Personal Profile Web Page

This is my first AltSchool assignment, where I created a simple web page showcasing my personal profile. The page includes:

- 📝 **Basic Information** and **AltSchool ID**.
- 📖 **Biography**.
- 🌟 **Reasons for Joining AltSchool**.
- 🎯 **Goals for the School of Engineering Program**.
- ⬆️ **Fragment Identifier Feature** to enable scrolling back to the top of the page.

> **Note:** This project was built strictly with **HTML**.
